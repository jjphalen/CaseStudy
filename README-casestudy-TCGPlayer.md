## Overview and Origin

* TCG Player

* Incorporated in 1998

* Founded by Chedy Hampson

* The founders worked at hobby stores and from the interest they saw at the shop, they created content websites and later incorporated databases of articles, decks, and prices.  Today they operate as a major price data index for collectible card games and have created a card selling marketplace to connect hobby stores to enthusiasts. - (tcgplayer.com - about us) 

* Recently TCG Player received a $10 million growth equity investment from Radian Capital (WSJ.com).  The company has been generating revenue from data subscriptions fees and commissions from online card sales using its marketplace. 


## Business Activities:

TCG Player solves two financial problem for an unconventional market - collectible card game card prices.  The first is that there are many collectible trading cards with varying conditions and print editions that are bought and sold daily online.  This amount of price discovery is beneficial to hobby stores and collectors who want to buy/sell their cards at the true market price.  TCG player in the past used all bid/offer/actual sales data available to them on such sources as eBay and hobby stores, but now they have a marketplace of their own and can use real time sales data to mark card values. (TCGPlayer.com - Market Price)  

The second is that the hobby stores need a manageable and affordable tech solution for selling and buying cards outside of their local markets, self-made websites, and eBay.  The amount of pricing data and relationships they have curated over the years gives them an advantage as a card broker - they are effectively an online broker for cards - their online market place pairs buyers and sellers in a very particular market and they have setup a search GUI that offers all of the parameters that collectors consider when making a card purchase.  This not only connects hobby shops to new markets online markets, it gives them cost advantages purchases that they can sell in their physical stores.

They have also addressed how to pair trading card stores with inventory below market prices through the Buylist feature.  TCG aggregates all participating stores buy lists - the cards a store needs to buy due to low inventory and demand - with collectors willing to sell a collection of their cards at a discount to cash out quickly (Youtube.com - Tolarian Community College).  This takes database matching features and capitalizes on the larger scale that TCG player has.

The intended customer is the hobby shops and the collectors are the market that TCG Players offers to the Hobby Shops.  The Hobby Shop is a customer though the commissions payed for card sales, the fees for data services, and the fees and deposits payed for the Buylist program.

The Card Games market revenue is $573 million projected for the 2019 year and is inclusive of all Trading Card Games, Standard Decks - traditional playing cards, and Individual Decks like Uno or Taro cards (Statista.com - Card Games)  

The advantage of TCG player is that they have been tracking prices on individual cards for 2 decades and have become a widely adopted resource for Trading Card Game price information.  They have built their data capabilities in their marketplace to offer matching features on both the individual card and bulk purchase transactions between hobby stores and sellers.  The marketplace GUI has optimization features to get the collector the cards they want at the best price for a basket of cards.  They also can match a collectors' sell lists to many hobby stores buy lists.  These are technical solutions that allow a hobby store to focus on the physical store or offer some opportunities for some major ecommerce sellers.  The biggest competitor for collectors has to be eBay.  The advantage that TCG Player has is the aforementioned ability to buy a basket of cards through an optimization program rather than having to scan ebay for every card and compare it to TCG Player pricing to see if it is accurate.

The technologies currently being used are APIs, databases, picture scanning technology, AWS, tools for monitoring, scripting, logging.

A DevOps engineer would need to know the following  - taken directly from job posting (TCGPlayer.com - Current Job Openings):

* Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes
* Load balancing and multi-layer application stacks
* At least one cloud provider, with a strong preference for AWS
* Configuration management tools (Chef, Ansible, Salt)
* Continuous integration tools (Jenkins, Travis, Circle, Bamboo, etc.)
* Deployment orchestration tools (Octopus Deploy, Jenkins, AWS CodeDeploy, etc.)
* Scripting languages (PowerShell, Bash, Python, etc.)
* Monitoring tools (New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus, etc.)
* Logging tools (ELK Stack, Splunk, Loggly, Scalyr)
* Operational knowledge of infrastructure (Redis, Linux, Elasticsearch, AWS)


A Sr. Database Administrator would need the following - taken directly from job posting (TCGPLayer.com - Current Job Openings):

* MSSQL Server 2014/2016
* PowerShell 
* Windows/Linux server administration
* Thorough understanding of database architecture design (particularly in an AWS environment)
* Ability to compare/contrast RDBMS platforms 
* RDBMS, NoSQL, caching technologies (MSSQL, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, MySQL, etc.)


## Landscape:

The company is in the ecommerce and pricing data / editorial sector specific to Trading Card Games.  This is a specific market where TCG Player seems to have put most of their resources into the data base engineering sector of their business to have the capability to match hobby stores with consumers at a level that caters to their customers' needs rather a broad solution for all types of goods, like eBay.

Companies similar to TCG include hobby shops with a major online shop presence such as Star City Games.  eBay has a major market for connecting trading card buyers and sellers.  The difference is that TCG Player has improved match making technology and pricing data.

## Results

The company's biggest impact has been pricing discovery and database indexing of pricing data for a market that was previously unstructured and stranded in some areas.  The ability to connect hobby shops to a market in an organized way with matching algorithms so they connect many collectors to many hobby shops on a per order basis is what makes them unique.  Continuously developing tech solutions for hobby shops will give TCG more data to work with, especially their new projects, which include using their application to manage store inventory and take payment (TCGPlayer.com - Seller).

The best way to test results is to see how many hobby stores are using their technologies across the US.  They can also measure how many third party software applications use their API data.  They could compare final sales to listings volume to see if the marketplace is effective.  Their fee based revenue growth is another important metric.  This is a private company so this data isn't openly available.

## Recommendations

One of the biggest differences between TCG Player and who I would call their closest rival - eBay - is the ability to post bids, auctions, and make best offers.  Cards are a commodity and if the marketplace is truly an exchange, right now it is one sided by only showing offers from sellers (the postings) and bids from sellers as Buylists.  If a collector could post what they are willing to pay for a card - this would move some of the business from eBay for collectors who submit best offers and only bid on auctions to get the best deals.  This would take some modification of the existing platform and some more database structure.

If they added auctions, they could really compete with eBay, especially if the matching algorithm could create a basket of cards to bid on together for the best price in a dutch auction format.  The hobby stores would give their lowest price they would accept for a collection of cards.  This would take more advanced algorithms and database structure as well.
